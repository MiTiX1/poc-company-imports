With an annual growth of around 10%, fish farming is one of the most dynamic sectors in the food industry. The sector's growth drives an increasing demand for fish feed containing high-quality protein. Currently, the protein intake in the diet of farmed fish comes mainly from wild fish meal and soy meal, both of which present limitations. Wild fish meal is becoming less and less available because of decreasing wild fish populations worldwide and soy meal has limited nutritional value as fish feed. InnovaFeeds' innovating insect rearing process is deployed on an industrial scale to address the strain on natural resources in a responsible and sustainable way. We contribute to the growth of a high-quality fish farming sector by providing a new source of sustainable and natural protein at a competitive price. InnovaFeed's insect rearing process also produces insect oil rich in lauric acid and an organic fertilizer. Equipped with the largest production capacity in the market and expertise at the forefront of biotech research, our model is supported by many key actors in the scientific, political and financial fields.",

(NYSE: HOT) in November 2005. With more than 80 of its properties located in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, Le M\u00e9ridien provided a strong international complement to Starwood's then primarily North American holdings at the time of purchase. Since then, Le M\u00e9ridien has gone through a brand re-launch, which included a large scale hotels product consolidation as well as redefining its brand strategy. Through creation of the LM100 artist community, Le M\u00e9ridien has transformed numerous guest touch points, thus bringing unique, interactive and curated experiences to its guests. Plans call for dynamic expansion of Le M\u00e9ridien Hotels and Resorts within the next five years, concentrating on markets in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Le M\u00e9ridien recently opened new hotels in Bali (Indonesia), Atlanta (Georgia, USA), Dallas (Texas, USA), Santa Monica (California, USA), Yixing (China), Zhengzhou (China), Cairo (Egypt), and will open in the next 12 months in Bangkok (Thailand), Gujarat (India), Mahabaleshwar (India), Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Chicago (Illinois, USA), Indianapolis (Indiana, USA), Tampa (Florida, USA) and Columbus (Ohio, USA).

Carried in 200+ SAS stores and over 1,500 retailers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Korea, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Israel-the San Antonio Shoemakers brand is a humble American success story, and continues to be a family-owned enterprise driven by an obsession with fit and quality.

Passou a atuar no setor de insumos agr\u00edcolas, na d\u00e9cada de 80, originando a Patureba Fertilizantes. Em 1986 foi instalada sua 1\u00aa f\u00e1brica de fertilizantes s\u00f3lidos e em 1992, entrou em opera\u00e7\u00e3o a 1\u00aa f\u00e1brica de fertilizantes fluidos, comercial, em Minas Gerais. Em 2000 surge a Terrena Agroneg\u00f3cios Ltda. A partir de 2004 passou a atuar tamb\u00e9m na presta\u00e7\u00e3o de servi\u00e7os, onde surgiu o departamento de agricultura de precis\u00e3o. Para tanto investiu na contrata\u00e7\u00e3o de profissionais, na capacita\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos, em equipamentos de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de fertilizantes \u00e0 taxa vari\u00e1vel e modernizou seu centro de an\u00e1lises para atender a nova demanda. Investiu na constru\u00e7\u00e3o da 2\u00aa unidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de fertilizantes s\u00f3lidos, em 2005, dobrando a capacidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o instalada. Modernizou tamb\u00e9m seu sistema de recebimento de mat\u00e9rias-primas que trouxe maior agilidade ao processo e melhoria da qualidade dos fertilizantes. Focados no atendimento da cultura da cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar no estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, ampliou novamente sua estrutura com a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da 2\u00aa ind\u00fastria de fertilizantes fluidos, sediada em Sert\u00e3ozinho - SP em 2016. Para melhor atender os produtores rurais nas regi\u00f5es de atua\u00e7\u00e3o da empresa, suas unidades de neg\u00f3cios se encontram distribu\u00eddas nas seguintes localidades: Patos de Minas - MG (Matriz); Paracatu - MG; Patroc\u00ednio - MG; Ibi\u00e1 - MG; S\u00e3o Gotardo - MG; Carmo do Parana\u00edba - MG e Sert\u00e3ozinho - SP. Hoje a Terrena Agroneg\u00f3cios se constitui na segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o de uma empresa que tem suas ra\u00edzes na terra e a vis\u00e3o al\u00e9m dos campos e continua na sua busca constante de aprimoramento de seus produtos e servi\u00e7os, procurando capacitar n\u00e3o s\u00f3 profissionalmente toda a sua equipe, mas acima de tudo propiciando condi\u00e7\u00f5es para que seu potencial humano seja desenvolvido.",

Our earliest CEWs represented a revolution in non-lethal weaponry, giving officers a safer alternative to more traditional types of force. More recently, our suite of connected products from body cameras to evidence management, has given law enforcement agencies the flexibility and the versatility to operate with increased transparency and efficiency. As of 2015, our CEWs are in use in more than 17,000 agencies across the United States and our other Axon family of products are in use by over 5,000 agencies. Our Scottsdale, Seattle and New York City teams approach their work with a spirit of collaborative innovation, developing new products and services with the knowledge that they are helping to usher in the future of policing.

The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk to revolutionize space transportation, with the ultimate goal of making life multiplanetary. SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. The company made history again in May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station, exchanged cargo payloads, and returned safely to Earth - a technically challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments. Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA. For more information, visit www.spacex.com.",

To deliver on this, we serve with passion, with a spirit of excellence, offering products and services for all stages of life, every moment of the day, helping people care for themselves and their families. Our culture is based on our values rooted in respect: respect for ourselves, respect for others, respect for diversity and respect for the future. We can trace our origin back to 1866, when the first European condensed milk factory was opened in Cham, Switzerland, by the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company. One year later, Henri Nestl\u00e9, a trained pharmacist, launched one of the world's first prepared infant cereals 'Farine lact\u00e9e' in Vevey, Switzerland. Today, we employ around 328,000 people and have factories or operations in almost every country in the world. With our headquarters still based in the Swiss town of Vevey, we had sales of CHF 89.5 billion in 2016. Our portfolio covers almost every food and beverage category -offering products and services for all stages of life, every moment of the day, helping people care for themselves and their families.",

Our Purpose is to push the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines. We believe the best way we can achieve our Purpose is to put science at the centre of everything we do. Science defines who we are. It is why we come to work every day and is part of our DNA. But this is only half of the story. We know that we do not have all the answers. We want to share ideas because we believe it results in better medicines. We want the way we work to be inclusive, open and collaborative. This approach runs through all that we do. We focus on three main therapy areas - Oncology, Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease (CVMD) and Respiratory - and we are also selectively active in the areas of autoimmunity, neuroscience and infection. To put ourselves in the best position to push the boundaries of science, we seek to leverage our combination of capabilities, which encompass both small molecules and biologics, and include immunotherapies and developing innovative delivery devices that can offer choice to patients. These are reinforced by a strong focus on personalised healthcare capabilities, which aim to match medicines only to those patients who will benefit from them. Our teams also work alongside the world's leading academic and biotech research institutions to stimulate innovation and evaluate emerging technologies such as Modified RNA and CRISPR genome editing. AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide. For more information, visit www.astrazeneca.com.",
