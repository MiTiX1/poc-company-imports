            "description": "InnovaFeed is a biotech company that produces a new source of protein from insect rearing (Hermetia illucens) for animal feed, more specifically for aquaculture. With an annual growth of around 10%, fish farming is one of the most dynamic sectors in the food industry. The sector's growth drives an increasing demand for fish feed containing high-quality protein. Currently, the protein intake in the diet of farmed fish comes mainly from wild fish meal and soy meal, both of which present limitations. Wild fish meal is becoming less and less available because of decreasing wild fish populations worldwide and soy meal has limited nutritional value as fish feed. InnovaFeeds' innovating insect rearing process is deployed on an industrial scale to address the strain on natural resources in a responsible and sustainable way. We contribute to the growth of a high-quality fish farming sector by providing a new source of sustainable and natural protein at a competitive price. InnovaFeed's insect rearing process also produces insect oil rich in lauric acid and an organic fertilizer. Equipped with the largest production capacity in the market and expertise at the forefront of biotech research, our model is supported by many key actors in the scientific, political and financial fields.",

            "description": "Hager Group is a leading supplier of solutions and services for electrical installations in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. Hager brand, with products ranging from energy distribution through cable management and wiring accessories to building automation and security systems, represents the core business of the company. Other brands of Hager Group are Berker, Bocchiotti, Daitem and Diagral, as well as Efen and Elcom. This allows the group to combine all the skills necessary for the development of innovative products, systems and services required for building automation. Together with the customers from industry and the electrical trade, Hager Group is working on future topics such as electro-mobility, Ambient Assisted Living, where building automation facilitates the everyday life of the elderly and individuals who require care, and on the networking of energy-efficient housing, which will provide greater comfort while requiring less energy consumption. The link between many of these technologies will be the distribution board, the product with which the company has achieved its growth. The company was founded in 1955 by Hermann Hager and Dr. Oswald Hager together with their father Peter, and today remains an independent business, owned and run by members of the Hager family, with its head office in Blieskastel, Germany. The organisation of the company as a European Company (Societas Europaea, SE) underlines both its cultural diversity and its European roots. Hager Group is, nevertheless, a worldwide business: 11,400 employees generate a turnover of around 1.9 billion euros (in 2016). Components and solutions are produced in 25 production sites around the globe and customers in 136 countries all over the world trust in them.",

The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk to revolutionize space transportation, with the ultimate goal of making life multiplanetary. SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. The company made history again in May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station, exchanged cargo payloads, and returned safely to Earth - a technically challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments. Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA. For more information, visit www.spacex.com.",

To deliver on this, we serve with passion, with a spirit of excellence, offering products and services for all stages of life, every moment of the day, helping people care for themselves and their families. Our culture is based on our values rooted in respect: respect for ourselves, respect for others, respect for diversity and respect for the future. We can trace our origin back to 1866, when the first European condensed milk factory was opened in Cham, Switzerland, by the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company. One year later, Henri Nestl\u00e9, a trained pharmacist, launched one of the world's first prepared infant cereals 'Farine lact\u00e9e' in Vevey, Switzerland. Today, we employ around 328,000 people and have factories or operations in almost every country in the world. With our headquarters still based in the Swiss town of Vevey, we had sales of CHF 89.5 billion in 2016. Our portfolio covers almost every food and beverage category -offering products and services for all stages of life, every moment of the day, helping people care for themselves and their families.",

To achieve our vision, we are developing reusable rocket engines and launch vehicles that will dramatically lower the cost of access to space. Our record-setting New Shepard was the first fully reusable vertical takeoff, vertical landing space vehicle, flying five times above the Karman line and landing safely back on Earth. Powered by our robust BE-3 engine, New Shepard is preparing to take astronauts to space and back starting in 2018. We've also introduced the New Glenn orbital launch vehicle designed for operational reusability. BE-4, the world's most powerful liquid oxygen / liquefied natural gas engine, will enable New Glenn to launch payloads over 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit and 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit beginning in 2020. Driven by our motto, Gradatim Ferociter or \"step by step, ferociously,\" our incremental approach builds upon each success as we develop ground-breaking spaceflight systems. We don't just build rockets-we build a culture around methodical innovation and exploration. Are you ready to go to space?",

Nel gennaio 2008 viene inaugurato il Mercedes-Benz Center Milano in via Daimler 1, decretato il pi\u00f9 grande Centro Mercedes-Benz del Sud Europa. A gennaio 2010 Mercedes-Benz Milano apre un nuovo, moderno Centro Veicoli Industriali a nord di Milano (Lainate - in Via D. Scarlatti 1), che ospita anche la pi\u00f9 grande carrozzeria in Italia per Van e Vetture.

Our Purpose is to push the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines. We believe the best way we can achieve our Purpose is to put science at the centre of everything we do. Science defines who we are. It is why we come to work every day and is part of our DNA. But this is only half of the story. We know that we do not have all the answers. We want to share ideas because we believe it results in better medicines. We want the way we work to be inclusive, open and collaborative. This approach runs through all that we do. We focus on three main therapy areas - Oncology, Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease (CVMD) and Respiratory - and we are also selectively active in the areas of autoimmunity, neuroscience and infection. To put ourselves in the best position to push the boundaries of science, we seek to leverage our combination of capabilities, which encompass both small molecules and biologics, and include immunotherapies and developing innovative delivery devices that can offer choice to patients. These are reinforced by a strong focus on personalised healthcare capabilities, which aim to match medicines only to those patients who will benefit from them. Our teams also work alongside the world's leading academic and biotech research institutions to stimulate innovation and evaluate emerging technologies such as Modified RNA and CRISPR genome editing. AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide. For more information, visit www.astrazeneca.com.",
